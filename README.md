## :notebook: Background:
PD's SwagShop was inspired from my love for quilting and wanting to share it with the rest of the world. I wanted to create an app where I could post quilts that I had worked on and have people come leave their thoughts on them. I also wanted to provide a resource page where people could find easy access to find information on quilting.
